make new db table that will contain a record for every data value that ever exists past that point
it will have bare minimum number of cols necessary for uniquely identifying all data values
    just enough so that you can sort values into the categories below
jk; this can be done based on primary keys alone?
categories:
1. new; not in cuahsi (hmm. i shouldnt ever have 1s i guess. it's the R script that will be populating this table, and that same R script will be doing to cuahsi uploading, so new records in the data table will be discovered and uploaded at almost the same time. maybe i should retain this category for the case where upload fails
2. uploaded to cuahsi
3. removed from our system since uploading to cuahsi
4. removed from our system before upload to cuahsi?
5. removed from cuahsi (i'll have to ask liza to do this for me periodically)
6x. manually changed within our database, so should be updated within cuahsi
    instead of this, i should just make sure i always fully delete and replace records when i need to change them
    and give the old records status 3 or 4 and the new records status 1

in my cuahsi upload script, i should check for:
1s and upload them
2s, 4s, 5s and ignore them
3s and add them to a file that i send to liza once a month or so


change name of NC_Advanced.xlsx to make it general
whenever this changes, rerun cuahsi_upload_metadata.R script; make sure it's self-sufficient

if a site appears that is not in the cuahsi metadata, log an exception and maybe email me

gotta sort out data levels and methods from foreign sites before i can put them on cuahsi

create table data_history select id from data;
alter table data_history add column cuahsi_status int(1) default(1);

create cuahsi status table
