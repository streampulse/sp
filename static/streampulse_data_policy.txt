# StreamPULSE Data Policy

The StreamPULSE data offered in this download are shared to enhance information reuse and scientific discovery. Two data products are made available:

1. Sensor and manual field observations: these data may not be fully vetted and in many cases are preliminary.
2. Metabolism model output: these data are versioned estimates of metabolism based on field observations and network-recognized models.

These data are made available under the Open Data Commons Attribution License: http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1.0.


## For users:
In summary, you are free:

- To Share: To copy, distribute and use the database.
- To Create: To produce works from the database.
- To Adapt: To modify, transform and build upon the database.

As long as you:

- Attribute: You must attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the license. For any use or redistribution of the database, or works produced from it, you must make clear to others the license of the database and keep intact any notices on the original database.

Citation: The StreamPULSE policy is that all data will be properly cited, with reference to StreamPULSE as well as the data set contributor. [Citation example here, coming soon. In the meantime, you can email vlahm13@gmail.com]

Acknowledgement: If the data contributed significantly to the content of a publication, the user should also acknowledge the StreamPULSE network, the NSF Macrosystems program, and any additional institutional support or funding awards referenced in the metadata. For example:

> Data sets were provided by the StreamPULSE Network, with funding provided by the National Science Foundation Macrosystems program (NSF Grant EF-1442439).

Notification: The data user should notify the data contributor when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the data set is distributed.


## For contributors:
Contributed data will be made available under the above license. Individual contributing sites may request that sensor and manual field observations be embargoed for a period of time by contacting a project representative (e.g., vlahm13@gmail.com) before uploading data. If this request is not received and confirmed, then all uploaded sensor and manual field observations will be made immediately publicly available. All metabolism model estimates will be publicly available under the above license.
