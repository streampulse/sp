<p>Hello StreamPULSE user,</p>
<p>
  Sorry, but something went wrong while we were processing your recent upload:
    {filename}
</p>
<p>
  Common reasons for this include:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Datetime formatting issues. If your upload uses the <code>_XX.csv</code> file extension,
      your datetime column must be the first column, and it must be formatted <code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</code>.
      Sometimes Excel changes datetime formatting and doesn't tell you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Error messages masquerading as data values.
    </li>
    <li>
      Our server trying to do too much at once!
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  If your upload complies with all of the
  <a href="https://data.streampulse.org/series_upload">instructions</a>
  and you're still receiving this message, please contact
  <a href='mailto:streampulse.info@gmail.com'>StreamPULSE development</a>.
